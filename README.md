## introduction to the course-

Statistics 240 is a first course in data science and statistical modeling at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. The course aims to enable you, the student in the course, to gain insight into real-world problems from messy data using methods of data science. These notes chart an initial path for you to gain the knowledge and skills needed to become a data scientist.

1.1 Case Studies
The structure of the course is to present a series of case studies that will allow you to discover answers to interesting questions through a process of data analysis from data sets related to some engaging real-world issues from a variety of domains, such as climate change, travel, health, animal behavior, the election, the search for exoplanets, and more. Each case study will take you through a common approach when encountered with new data: import, clean and tidy, transform, visualize, model, gain insight and understanding, and then communicate. In early case studies, many of the steps are provided so that you can focus on deep and detailed learning on a single stage of the data analysis process. In subsequent case studies, you will get to practice previously learned skills on new data while learning details about a different stage of the process. By the end of the semester, you will have gained a level of mastery which will allow you to carry out all steps of a basic analysis with novel data. You will have worked to gain a new power to learn about the world on your own.
