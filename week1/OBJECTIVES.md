How has the duration that Lake Mendota is closed by ice (at least 50% covered by ice) changed over time?

1. Are there changes to the typical dates that Lake Mendota first freezes in the winter and finally thaws in the spring?

2. Can we predict the thaw date based on the date the lake first freezes?

3. Can we predict the total duration that the lake will be frozen in the upcoming winter?

4. Is the model for the trend appropriate? Would a simpler straight-line model be adequate?

5. Can we characterize the distribution of variation around the trend line?

6. Is the rate of decrease in the total freeze duration larger now than it was between 1850 and 1900?
