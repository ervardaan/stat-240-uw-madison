## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

question 1
 
 instead of i we wrote l and so r is not able to find the variable
 
 question3
 
 we get to the quick keyboard shortcut reference and the pop up shows up
 
 other way-go to tools on menu bar>Keyboard Shortcuts Help
 
 question4
 
 save a particular plot rather than the last one saved on the disk-extract all plots into separate variables and then use ggsave(filename="name",plot=variable storing the plot we need to save)



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
